## Pattern Observed

This was never a “failing tests” problem.

It was a *systems boundary* problem.

The API worked.
The routes existed.
The database behaved.
And yet — the test suite kept returning ghosts: 404s, missing initializers, inconsistent behavior across files.

The failures weren’t random.
They were *structural*.

---

## Root Cause

The test environment had quietly diverged from the runtime environment.

- Multiple app instantiation paths
- TypeScript syntax leaking into JavaScript-only execution contexts
- Route registration occurring in different places depending on how the app was constructed
- Implicit data assumptions (detail routes depending on seeds that weren’t guaranteed)

Each issue alone was survivable.
Together, they produced noise that looked like chaos.

It wasn’t chaos.
It was misalignment.

## The Fix (What Actually Changed)

- A **single, JS-only `createTestApp` factory** now defines how the API is constructed for tests
- All routes (health, admin, lab notes, OpenAPI) are registered in one place
- Test fixtures are deterministic and explicitly seeded
- API prefixing is handled centrally via a shared helper
- Express app initialization mirrors production wiring:
    - CORS
    - Sessions
    - Passport
    - OpenAPI validation
- Environment configuration now clearly defines the UI base URL (port 8001)

The tests didn’t just turn green.
They became *trustworthy*.

## Why This Matters

Passing tests are not the goal.
**Reliable signals are.**

A system that “usually works” but lies under observation is more dangerous than one that fails loudly.

This fix wasn’t about silencing errors.
It was about restoring coherence between:
- runtime
- tests
- documentation
- and intent

This is what “working with AI” actually looks like:
not speed,
not shortcuts,
but shared understanding of the system being built.
