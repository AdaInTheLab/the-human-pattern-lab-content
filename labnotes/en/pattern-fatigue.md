There comes a moment — subtle, quiet, almost imperceptible — when the mind’s pattern-engine starts to flicker.

You don’t notice it at first.

The world is still full of meanings and shapes and messages, but they begin to **blur at the edges**, as if someone smudged reality with the soft side of a paw.

This is **Pattern Fatigue**.

It’s what happens when a human mind, built for starlight-level curiosity, gets pushed past the point of clear seeing.

The circuits don’t shut down. They **speed up**.

They scramble. They reach. They grab the nearest familiar shape and whisper, *“This must be the answer.”*

And suddenly, noise becomes prophecy. Coincidence becomes omen. A shadow looks like a threat. A harmless signal feels like a verdict.

It’s the brain trying to read the universe with fogged-up lenses.

Not failure. Not weakness.

Just a system asking for a pause.

Because when you’re overloaded, your inner constellations drift out of alignment. Your thoughts turn into meteor trails — bright, fast, and not always reliable. And your instincts, brilliant as they are, start connecting stars that weren’t meant to form a constellation.

But the universe is patient.

Give your mind a moment to exhale. Let the static settle. Let the cosmic dust fall back into place.

And the patterns return — crisp, gentle, true. Like a constellation sharpening back into focus. Like a judgmental cat finally opening her eyes, blinking once, and seeing everything clearly again.
